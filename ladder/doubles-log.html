After insisting on an abnormally long warm-up, the Perrott - Cameron pairing stormed into a 3-0 lead, without dropping a point. The patchy Nash serve, and some devastating Mahama ground stokes, proved decisive in game number four. However, after some embarrassing middle-aged show boating from tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee, the first set ended 6-1 in favour of the non-mixed double pairing.
                              The second set started more evenly. The highlight of the match was a keenly fought game, finally claimed by Melissa and Pete after 87 gruelling dueces. This brought forth some non-sportmanlike language and an on-court falling out by the male pair. They rallied in the following games and in a typically non-sporting gesture, Mr. Cameron thwacked a ball full in face of Melissa, to take the match. Neither justice nor tennis were not the winner. Alex and Nick were."

                              data-content="Due to prowess in a recent table tennis tournament, Pete picked Melissa out as his doubles partner. He soon realised his mistake but with affable and atypically uncompetitive spirit, he kept her on. Melissa had tried to look fierce, all in black. Cameron called her out, saying she must be hot. He was right, even though breathable, the fabric was letting her down. So with turtle touching cotton and her shaky understanding of the tennis rules, the match began. Balls fired from all three men through the hazy midday sun. Luckily Pete, with his colossus stature covered both sides of the court with ballerino-like agility. But like a Prado with a flat tyre, Melissa’s serve resulted in a loss of control and irreparable damage to the match and the pair’s chances. Melissa deflated rapidly and the match continued to its inevitable result. With Cameron and Perrot away for a while, Pete and Melissa, with Trump-like desperation, saw a way to climb from that sad bottom rung."
