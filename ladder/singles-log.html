Yishak stroked the call like Brian Love in his prime ( he was a lad in my class in the 4th form). There are no easy games at this level, both player have a good touch for big men,  Perott parked the bus - everyone behind the ball, Yishak attacked with poise and flare, there were some tired legs out there but Nick came through to win. Like Dave Chapman once remarked ‘ ladders go up and down’ ( he was a window cleaner ) thanks for the game Yishak ( he doesn’t have WhatsApp)"

This was to prove the battle of all battles, the sort of match which you settle yourself into your chair and prepare yourself for 7 hours of nervewracking tension.  The first set was decided by a tiebreaker:12 -10. We had been on court for over an hour by the time we pushed on through. There had been no leeway at any point. Most games went to deuce.  Every game lasted ten mins (ish). No separation was permitted. The Combster would win, the Cameron would take one back. One would break, the other would break back. Both participants almost vomited with nerves. They thought theyd run out of water at one point.  Dinner plans were almost cancelled. A top of the ladder fight to the death. And while the second set was decided in more decisive fashion, there could only be one victor. Step forward Rosie Combe. I’m so tired I need to 💤"

                              Like all infamous battles it started with a disparity: the might of Campbell pitted against the underdog Sherman. But unlike great battles of old, David did not triumph over Goliath today. Occurring exactly 100 years after the Franco-Syria war, this evening’s battle was no less acrimonious or one-sided. 6-2. 6-3. All-in-all a bloodbath, and one which sees Fraser climb one step higher on that great ladder known as glory."

The warm-up is over and William will serve. At the beginning of the first set the players exchange some gorgeous groundstrokes, Pete looking to take the initiative with his forehand before seeing William belt lots of his own out down the line. 4-4 and Pete manages to get the break and wins the next four, finishing with a booming first serve and that's 6-4. The crowd would be ready to explode. The clock ticks to 25 min as William comes out to serve with the heavily used balls. 3-1 for William, Gasps all round. A new paragraph is called for… 6-4 for William and the tiebreaker to go. A forehand error gives Pete a fourth mini break point and this time, William succumbs - pummelling a string of forehands before putting one millimetres before the fence. Pete will serve for the match. William slaps another forehand into the net and Pete claims his victory. 6-4 4-6 (8-6). An emotional William said: ’I tried everything and most of it went out!
                              Congrats to Pete. It's been a joy to play at AATC. It's a shame I couldn't win today but I'll be back next week for tennis night.’"

The scores went 1-0, 1-1, 2-1, 2-2, and then, with consistently solid serves, plenty of killer backspin, and loads of clinical finishes, Fraser went on to take the first set 6-2. Maiuran put up a bit more of a fight in the second set, but Fraser proved too good with a flourish of cool finishes to win the match 6-2 6-3, and move up a place in the ladder.
